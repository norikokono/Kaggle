While LLMs are celebrated for their remarkable ability to generate fluent, human-like text, how deep does their \"understanding\" truly go?\n","</p>\n","\n","<p>\n","To find out, I subjected the model to a series of increasingly difficult challenges. I started by using the model to simulate \"spicy\" philosophical debates on the future of AI. Then, I challenged it with a simple, concrete reasoning test that any human child could solve.\n","</p>\n","\n","<p>\n","The results were both impressive and startling.

The Experiment: Fluency vs. Reasoning</h2>\n","\n","<p>\n","We've all seen large language models (LLMs) produce fluent, coherent, and often deeply nuanced prose.

(e.g., counting the occurrences of a letter in a word).</li>\n","</ul>\n","\n","<p>\n","My hypothesis was that the model would excel at Task 1, where stylistic fluency and access to a vast dataset of human opinions are key.

Methodology</h2>\n","\n","<p>\n","To conduct this experiment, I ran all code on a CPU using the \n","<code style=\"background:#e0e0ff; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;\">jax</code> backend to evaluate the model's performance without high-end hardware.\n","</p>\n","\n","<ul style=\"padding-left: 1.2rem;\">\n","  <li><strong>For the Debates:</strong> I created a <code style=\"background:#f5f5f5; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;\">DebateAgent</code> class.
